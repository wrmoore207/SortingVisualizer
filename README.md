# Sorting Algorithm Visualization Web App

## Project Overview:
The Sorting Algorithm Visualization Web App is an interactive web application designed to visually demonstrate the workings of various sorting algorithms. This educational tool provides users with an intuitive and dynamic representation of sorting processes, aiding in the understanding of algorithmic concepts.

## Objectives:
1. **Algorithm Selection:**
   - Implement and visualize multiple sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
   - Allow users to choose and compare different algorithms for a comprehensive learning experience.
2. **User Interface (UI) Design:**
   - Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the web application.
   - Provide interactive elements, allowing users to control and manipulate the visualization.
3. **Real-time Visualization:**
   - Develop a real-time visualization of sorting algorithms using dynamic graphics and animations.
   - Enable users to observe the step-by-step execution of sorting algorithms on randomized datasets.
4. **Customization Options:**
   - Incorporate features for users to adjust input size, speed of visualization, and other parameters.
   - Allow users to start, pause, and reset the visualization for a hands-on learning experience.
5. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - Include brief explanations and educational content alongside the visualizations to aid in understanding.
   - Provide resources and links to further readings on sorting algorithms.
6. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the web application is responsive and accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
7. **Flask Integration:**
   - Utilize Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, to deploy the application on the web.
   - Enable easy access to the visualization tool through a web browser.
8. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the Sorting Algorithm Visualization Web App to a cloud hosting platform (e.g., Heroku or AWS) for public access.
   - Document the deployment process for future reference.
## Expected Outcome:

Upon completion, the Sorting Algorithm Visualization Web App will provide a user-friendly platform for individuals to learn and comprehend sorting algorithms through dynamic visualizations. Users will gain insights into the efficiency and mechanics of different sorting techniques, contributing to a deeper understanding of fundamental computer science concepts.
